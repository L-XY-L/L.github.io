        <h4>About This Site</h4>
        <p>
          The list lists papers related to the topic of homomorphic encryption posted on
          <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/">IACR's eprint archive</a> since January 2016.

          <em> Homomorphic encryption </em>is a cryptographic technique based on the computational complexity theory of mathematical problems.
          Processing homomorphic encrypted data results in an output that is decrypted, and the result is the same as if the original unencrypted data had been processed in the same way.

          I keep the list as a way for me to stay somewhat up to date with new developments in this
          area, and to have an easy way to find papers. The list is generated manually by going over
          the eprint RSS feed a few times a month. If you feel like I missed a paper let me know, and
          I will consider adding it to the list.
